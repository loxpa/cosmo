As you’re likely aware of by now, Apple dropped iOS 8.4 today with the new Apple Music service. This has proved to wildly popular, and many, including yours truly, didn’t hesitate to ditch the iOS 8.3 jailbreak for iOS 8.4. I personally did so knowing that the likelihood of an iOS 8.4 jailbreak was very high given the timing.



Well, not a few hours after 8.4 went live and everyone was enjoying the new Beats 1 radio station, news began to spread that a jailbreak was released. That, as it turns out, was true. The rest, as they say, is history.



Here’s our full roundup of the iOS 8.4 jailbreak. As we did with iSO 8.3, anything related to this firmware from a jailbreak perspective will be contained in this post.
