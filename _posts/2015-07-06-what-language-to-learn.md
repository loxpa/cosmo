Javascript and html are very powerful now, you wont believe there capabilities they are known as web languages but trust me they do more now they are now used in building mobile and desktop application(e.g Cordova:mobile apps and Brackets is a good example of desktop application build with this languages), Mobile and web games and  even now javascript is rendering PHP almost useless with it's ability to work on servers(IONIC). I know you've been asking yourslef the question "How will this help me manage my social life?" well it has ecevrything to do with it
      Most organizations demand this languages the most so you wil be at advantage if you focus on this languages.Also geeks are well known to be loners well that is because most of what they know most people dont so with this languages you will be able to express yourself on what you know.
