   <title>The Evolution Of Code</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Programming languages, believe it or not, have existed for over 200 years, since the invention of the punch-card-programmable &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_loom&quot;&gt;Jacquard loom&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn’t a programming language in the modern sense — there was no computation and no logic — but it started a cascade that would eventually lead to Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine, and Ada Lovelace’s 1842 deconstruction of his work which led to the first computer program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a whole 100 years before the first electrical, programmable computers would burst into existence, however. Machine-specific assembly language in the 1940s was probably the first (vaguely) human-readable programming language, but by the 1950s computer engineers realized that assembly language was far too laborious and error-prone to build entire systems out of — and thus in 1955 the first modern programming language was born: FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslator). LISP (LISt Processor), ALGOL (ALGOrithmic Language), and COBOL (COmmon Business Oriented Language) would follow in the next few years — and as they say, the rest is history. Almost every language today is a derived from one of these first four languages — and indeed, FORTRAN, LISP, and COBOL are still actively used by large, lumbering institutions like the National Weather Service and the US Postal Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 1964, BASIC had been invented, and then C was released in 1969. Unix was famously re-written into C — the first major OS to not be written in assembly language — and today, Linux is written almost entirely in C, and both Windows and Mac OS X have large swaths of their code written in C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the history of modern programming languages — because C was really just the beginning! — check out the infographic below. You can click it to zoom in.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Look At The Tech That Could Mean We Never Have To Charge Our Phones Again</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Technology that can wirelessly power our devices on the go could change our world. Imagine never having to plug in your cell phone again, or technology that continuously keeps your electronic car battery running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://pshared.5min.com/Scripts/PlayerSeed.js?sid=281&amp;amp;width=900&amp;amp;height=315&amp;amp;playList=518917978&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Energous Corporation, that day is just around the corner. Energous’ WattUp is a wireless charger for electronic devices. It can charge your cell phone and other battery-enabled devices on the go using something that is already abundantly flowing all around us – radio waves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several companies approaching this same problem in different ways. Nikola Labs presented at TechCrunch Disrupt a couple years back with the same idea – turning radio frequency signals into battery power. Energous told us that their tech could be ready for the consumer market possibly this next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to the company’s San Jose headquarters to take a look at how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The iOS 8.4 jailbreak roundup</title>
   <link href="http://blogcosmo.github.io/the-ios-8.4-jailbreak-roundup"/>
   <updated>2015-07-06T04:08:55+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://blogcosmo.github.io/the-ios-8.4-jailbreak-roundup</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you’re likely aware of by now, Apple dropped iOS 8.4 today with the new Apple Music service. This has proved to wildly popular, and many, including yours truly, didn’t hesitate to ditch the iOS 8.3 jailbreak for iOS 8.4. I personally did so knowing that the likelihood of an iOS 8.4 jailbreak was very high given the timing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not a few hours after 8.4 went live and everyone was enjoying the new Beats 1 radio station, news began to spread that a jailbreak was released. That, as it turns out, was true. The rest, as they say, is history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s our full roundup of the iOS 8.4 jailbreak. As we did with iSO 8.3, anything related to this firmware from a jailbreak perspective will be contained in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What language should you learn?</title>
   <link href="http://blogcosmo.github.io/what-language-to-learn"/>
   <updated>2015-06-20T04:08:55+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://blogcosmo.github.io/what-language-to-learn</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What language should you learn? For you to be social you have to put more intrest in  the social languages, languages that i consider social are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;JAVASCRIPT&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HTML5 AND CSS3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RUBY ON RAILS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javascript and html are very powerful now, you wont believe there capabilities they are known as web languages but trust me they do more now they are now used in building mobile and desktop application(e.g Cordova:mobile apps and Brackets is a good example of desktop application build with this languages), Mobile and web games and  even now javascript is rendering PHP almost useless with it’s ability to work on servers(IONIC). I know you’ve been asking yourslef the question “How will this help me manage my social life?” well it has ecevrything to do with it
      Most organizations demand this languages the most so you wil be at advantage if you focus on this languages.Also geeks are well known to be loners well that is because most of what they know most people dont so with this languages you will be able to express yourself on what you know.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Are you a geek or a nerd?</title>
   <link href="http://blogcosmo.github.io/are-you-a-geek-or-a-nird"/>
   <updated>2015-06-20T01:45:23+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://blogcosmo.github.io/are-you-a-geek-or-a-nird</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/geek.jpg&quot; /&gt;
Think you are a geek? Then you’d probably be offended if someone called you a nerd. Got nerd-pride? Then you probably look at geek culture as nothing more than glorified hipsterism. Think there isn’t a real difference between the two?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh brother, are you in for a rude awakening! Read below and discover just how wrong you are about the 4 main differences between geeks and nerds!
1) Interests&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to differentiate a geek from a nerd is by taking a look at their respective interests. The term “geek” has become associated with someone who has a vested interest in one particular thing and knows it on an expert level. While it isn’t uncommon for them to have more than one interest, there’s always one subject that takes precedence over the others. Nerds, on the other hand, concern themselves with academics such as math and science. As a result, they enjoy games of strategy (e.g. Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons) or watch television shows (e.g. Star Trek) that share this complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Attire&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nerds have always been of the conservative mindset when it comes to their clothing of choice: slacks, button down shirts, and dress shoes are some of this species’ favorites. As for eyewear, nerds don actual prescription glasses out of necessity and not to make an ironic or geeky fashion statement. Geeks, meanwhile, want their clothes to be a reflection of their interests. Sneakers, jeans, and a graphic tee featuring a cartoon, movie, or other intellectual property they enjoy is standard. However, geeks can sometimes be slovenly, tending to their interests more than… ehem… hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Future Occupations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right, even geeks and nerds need to make a living, but their career choices couldn’t be anymore disparate from each other. Geeks tend to gravitate toward jobs that let them indulge in their interests and use their obscure expertise on a particular subject for a more practical purpose. Ultimately, geeks want to have fun while they work, so it’s not surprising that they become writers, graphic artists, or animators. Nerds seek jobs that benefit from their devotion to all things academia. As such, they end up in fields with a focus on the applied sciences like computer programmers, scientists, and professional abacus builders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Social Interaction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interests of nerds and geeks have an impact on how they interact with others in a social setting. Since not many people share an appreciation for equations and scientific theory, nerds can sometimes be introverted and by extension not know how to respond appropriately in conversation. It’s because of this that nerds have a tendency to keep to themselves or seek the company of others that share complex and academic interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While geeks are shown to react better to social stimuli, their interests can also wreak havoc—and they may not even realize it. Due to passion for the subject, geeks can go off at length about their favorite comic, movie, or obscure early 1980s movie rock musical, leaving those that do not understand it out of the conversation and eventually bored. And, like we said before, the geek may be oblivious to these visual cues and continue to talk about the minute details of the fact that Brian DePalma’s true masterwork was the underrated musical Phantom of the Paradise that took the classic Phantom of the Opera story and transplanted it to the modern day record industry, thus making a strong statement about… hey… where are you guys going?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why do you need to be social!!!</title>
   <link href="http://blogcosmo.github.io/Why-do-you-need-to-be-social!!!!"/>
   <updated>2015-06-19T11:03:23+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://blogcosmo.github.io/Why-do-you-need-to-be-social!!!!</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Social….Social…Social..The mentality is that nerds and geeks are not meant to be social, An engineering manager told me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I would never hire an extremely introverted individual and don&#39;t even know how one would make it past the interview.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a programmer, you do spend a lot of time off on your own, but you’re not totally in a bubble or anything.  You’re frequently collaborating with other developers, support staff etc.  If you don’t have good social skills, those collaborations won’t be as good, and you’re less likely to advance quickly or sometimes even perform well (depending on the nature of your job and how you interact).
That said, there’s a huge difference between “introverted” and “poor social skills”.  I’m very introverted, and I’m a developer, but my social skills aren’t too bad.  My nature isn’t to seek out other people, but when I need to collaborate, I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, there are those that are condescending, rude, etc., and don’t communicate.  They won’t warn you when they made a change that might affect you, or when they altered your code to “be more efficient”.  Those types of behaviors can make someone very difficult to work with, and aren’t tied to introversion at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing is to act appropriately to your job function.  Whether or not you’re an introvert is pretty irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being an extrovert helps in a few areas, but it’s not really all that necessary.  It’ll help you convince your higher-ups that you should be allowed to go ahead with your POC, or something similar.  It’ll also help your personal relationships with the rest of your team (although I don’t think it’ll make you work all that much more effectively).&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://blogcosmo.github.io/whats-jekyll</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to cosmo blog, am not really a blog type of person but i just decided to start writing about what people like me really need to overcome there greatest distraction&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;NOTE: THIS WEBSITE WAS CODED ON A FRAMEWORK CALLLED JEKYLL A RUBY BASED PLATFORM.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to pick jekyll because am not a lazy programmer and i love doing things the hard way of cause there are easier way to write blogs i mean very easy ways, but we as programmers are meant to do things our own way and leave the other ways of blogging to those who can’t code.
