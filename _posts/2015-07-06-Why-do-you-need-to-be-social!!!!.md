Social....Social...Social..The mentality is that nerds and geeks are not meant to be social, An engineering manager told me
<blockquote>I would never hire an extremely introverted individual and don't even know how one would make it past the interview.
</blockquote> 
As a programmer, you do spend a lot of time off on your own, but you're not totally in a bubble or anything.  You're frequently collaborating with other developers, support staff etc.  If you don't have good social skills, those collaborations won't be as good, and you're less likely to advance quickly or sometimes even perform well (depending on the nature of your job and how you interact).
That said, there's a huge difference between "introverted" and "poor social skills".  I'm very introverted, and I'm a developer, but my social skills aren't too bad.  My nature isn't to seek out other people, but when I need to collaborate, I do.

By contrast, there are those that are condescending, rude, etc., and don't communicate.  They won't warn you when they made a change that might affect you, or when they altered your code to "be more efficient".  Those types of behaviors can make someone very difficult to work with, and aren't tied to introversion at all.

The important thing is to act appropriately to your job function.  Whether or not you're an introvert is pretty irrelevant.

Being an extrovert helps in a few areas, but it's not really all that necessary.  It'll help you convince your higher-ups that you should be allowed to go ahead with your POC, or something similar.  It'll also help your personal relationships with the rest of your team (although I don't think it'll make you work all that much more effectively).
